# nearest neighbor algorithm
phase 1. visit the nearest store from now position 50 times 
(each of them accept 1 time visit)
orders = []
from his office (400, 400)
for 50 times:
    position = the place that have minimal distance from former position
        and not visited before
    orders.append(position)
    visited[position] = True

for orders
    position = the place that have minimal distance from former position
        and not visited before
    houses.append(position)
    delivered[position] = True
